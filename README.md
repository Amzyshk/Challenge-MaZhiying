# Challenge-MaZhiying

This is my answer to the challenge questions for Lalamove internship. 

Please note that I made one assumption in my answer in terms of the input file as follows:

I'm not sure whether the first line of the file will be a redundant "repository,min_version" as in the example, or some actual data that needs to be processed. I assumed that there is no redundant lines in this file in my code.
